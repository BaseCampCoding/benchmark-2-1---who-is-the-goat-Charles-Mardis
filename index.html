        <p> He even let me cut my birthday cake with a katana. You read that right. A katana. There's never a dull moment with Dad. No matter if we are working on trucks, fishing, hunting, anything, my dad always finds a way to make things fun and exciting. </p>

        <p> One of my favorite memories with my dad, was when we went to the Huntsville Space Station. We were doing all the events and we didn't know it but we went into a kids event in the Planetterrium. I was lucky enough to get a video of us in there. When I tell people about my dad I show them that video. THe look on his face in that video just looks like pure happiness. That's all I want for my dad. He deserves it for every thing he's been through.</p>

        <p> He always helped me with Boy Scouts. He always made sure I could go on trips, campouts, fundraisers, anyhting. From jamboree to my Eagle Scout project, my dad was there. Willing to help me get there to helping me with anyhting I needed. </p>

        <p> There are so many good things I can say about my father, and very little bad things. I'm very grateful I got a Dad like Dad. </p>
        <p> That's why I'm happy to say my father is the Greatest of All Time at being a father. </p>
        <p> Love you Dad. </p>
